# Statistics

This repository includes programs I've written for statistical analysis. Descriptions of the programs can be found in the comment header
of each one.  
  
Currently there are two programs, both inspired from working through an introductory statistics class. One is for calculating a binomial probability distribution given p, q, n, and x. This outputs a table of
values, a sum of probabilities for a given range of x, and can graph a histogram of the data if desired. The other graphs a frequency 
histogram given a list of values.
